logging-hours
=============

Logging the hours of certain activities. In particular the following for 2015:
* Cycling
* Entertainment
* Programming
* Reading
* Yoga

The basic idea is to keep track of how many I spend on a certain activity by logging the hours. I've decided that the smallest unit will be the quarter hour. I'm going to keep a simple daily list of the above five in my Evernote so that it's easily accessible from any device. The cut-off time is going to 01:00 which is my usual bedtime and in some cases I will be doing one of the above right up until then. The totals for the day will be held in a basic text file with space separated values like so:

`0 1.0 0 1.0 0.75`

With each line representing one day and line zero being the first of January. A simple program can then show me totals for the week, the month, year and averages etc. No special software required.
